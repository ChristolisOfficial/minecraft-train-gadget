# Minecraft Train Gadget
This was supposed to be a train gadget that would get added in a Minecraft server named *BlocksMC*, but the idea was quickly scrapped after some days. If you'd like to contribute to this project and finish it yourself, you can contact me in Discord: `Christolis#5901`.

## Requirements
In order to export this code yourself, you are required to use the Spigot API, which can be found [here](https://getbukkit.org/get/hNiHm0tuqAg1Xg7w7zudk63uHr0xo48D).
